    "# What is a Digital Human?\n",
    "A Digital Human is a real-time, lifelike virtual character designed to interact with users using natural behaviors such as speech, facial expressions, gestures, and emotion. These characters are often powered by multi-component AI services, making them capable of understanding and responding in a human-like way.\n",

    "1. **The Brain** — *Language Understanding and Response*\n",
    "   - The digital human receives an input (usually voice, sometimes text or vision).  \n",
    "   - An **LLM** processes the input and generates a meaningful, natural-language response.  \n",
    "   - This brain can also drive decision-making, access databases, or trigger tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Voice** — *Speech Interaction (Speech Recognition + Text-to-Speech)*\n",
    "   - Converts the user’s spoken input into text (ASR).  \n",
    "   - Converts the AI’s text-based response into natural-sounding speech (TTS).  \n",

    "3. **The Face & Body** — *Animation Rendering*\n",
    "   - Uses the speech audio and metadata to animate a digital avatar's face, lips, and expressions in real time."

    "# 1.1 What Does it Take to Bring a Digital Human to Life?\n",
    "The end-to-end Digital Human Pipeline is a tightly integrated **pipeline of services and systems** that work together in real time to perceive input, generate intelligent responses, and express those responses through voice and animation.\n",

    "#### 🗣️ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Captures the user's spoken input and transcribes it into text.\n",
    "- Typically runs continuously with **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**.\n",
    "- Powers the understanding layer for voice-driven interaction.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts the generated text response into natural-sounding audio.\n",
    "- Many pipelines use expressive TTS models to convey tone, mood, or personality.\n",
    "- This audio is also used to drive facial animation (via visemes or blendshape data).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Chat and Behavior Logic (LLM / RAG / Agents)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **core “brain”** of the agent.\n",
    "- Most pipelines today use **LLMs** like GPT, LLaMA, or Claude to generate intelligent responses.\n",
    "- Many enhance LLMs with **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ground replies in custom knowledge.\n",
    "- Increasingly, **Agent frameworks** are layered on top to enable tool use, memory, multi-step workflows, and reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎭 Animation & Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Controls the **facial expressions, lip sync, eye gaze, and body posture** of the avatar.\n",
    "- Powered by services like **Audio2Face (A2F)** and **AnimGraph**.\n",
    "- The fidelity of animation depends on the quality of the avatar rig and how tightly it is integrated with the audio and behavior pipeline.\n",
