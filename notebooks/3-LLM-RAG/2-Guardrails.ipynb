    "# Intro to Guardrails\n",
    "Guardrails help enforce rules for LLM output using three major categories:\n",
    "- **Topical Guardrails** – Keep conversations focused by blocking or redirecting off-topic inputs.\n",
    "- **Safety Guardrails** – Prevent unsafe, harmful, or inappropriate responses.\n",
    "- **Security Guardrails** – Protect sensitive information and prevent risky outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails is a framework to easily add programmable guardrails between application logic and the LLM’s output. It supports full customization of rules and actions to take when interfacing with LLMs. For simplicity, this notebook will use pre-defined guardrail NIMs for basic topical and safety guardrails, but you can easily create and expand on these using the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the purpose and core types of NeMo Guardrails.\n",
    "- Learn how to apply guardrails using NVIDIA NIM models.\n",
    "- Evaluate model behavior in a museum guide scenario.\n",
    "- Build and test your own guardrails using documentation examples."
