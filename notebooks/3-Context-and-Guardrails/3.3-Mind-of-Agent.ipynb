    "Welcome to ***Module 3.3*** of the Digital Human Teaching Kit! After reviewing over key concepts towards the mind aspect of a digital human through content generation and direction, we will compile what we have learned into a Digital Human persona. By the end of this module, you will have created a DH persona capable of generating real-time content conversations with users within a safe, friendly, on-topic appropriate environment. \n",

    "In ***Modules 3.1*** and ***3.2***, we explored the foundational aspects of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, mastering various **prompt engineering techniques** to guide LLM behavior, and establishing robust **guardrail systems** to ensure safe and controlled interactions. You learned how to craft effective prompts for persona creation, structured outputs, and complex reasoning, as well as how to set boundaries with content filters and topical constraints."

We will consolidate these individual concepts into a cohesive, practical, and end-to-end example, demonstrating how prompt engineering strategies work in harmony with guardrail systems within a digital human pipeline.\n",

Through this environment, you are able to custom fit the mind of a Digital Humans into your chosen field of interest by creating the persona the DH will take, what set of instructions they must understand to take on the desired role, and ensuring the user experience reflects a helpful, robust, and natural Human-DH interaction.\n",

    "Having a strong understanding and skillset of the Digital Human mind will ensure what is to be desired from natural language interactions and how to better support that controlled experience. With the technological tools that NVIDIA provides, you will be able to seamlessly create these relevant, powerful, and accurate Digital Human minds towards your envisioned implementation.\n",

    "* *Utilize well-defined guardrails for user safety and on-topic conversations*\n",
    "* *Understand the iteration process towards a desired conversation flow*\n",

    "While prompt techniques help to develop a stronger, refined Digital Human mind that can generate the expected results, they are not able to help and assist when user inputs go awry. Large-Language Models allow generative content that can try to answer any user input given, even tasks that are not appropriate for the developed situation. LLMs are also able to encapsulate datasets from many different parts of the internet, including the ugly ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping that in mind, we have to guide these LLMs such that these models are no longer encapsulating all that is under generative and instead be under a controlled environment that allows for task-specific generability. We must develop ways to have these LLMs be hyper-focused on a task that can satisfy any requests with the specific task in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guardrails** are safety mechanisms that define and enforce the boundaries of your digital human's interactions. They act as a layer of control over the LLM's output, preventing harmful, irrelevant, or inappropriate responses. Guardrails enforce rules on the content generation depending on how the **Topical**, **Safety**, and **Security** guardrails are developed. With the guardrails, the digital human is able to understand if a rule violation occurred and how to better assess the situation through blocking or redirecting content and providing a safe response. Due to the guardrail intentions to keep the model on-topic and avoid unnecessary dialogue, it also is inherently an attempt to avoid **hallucinations**, generated occurances where the model creates a nonsensical, incorrect, and off-topic result while being confident in the answer for the sake of providing the user an \"answer\".
