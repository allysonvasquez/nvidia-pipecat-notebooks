    "# Intro to Speech Pipelines for Digital Humans\n",
    "This module introduces the core technical components of a real-time voice agent system, with a focus on speech-to-speech (S2S) processing. These pipelines form the backbone of interactive digital human applications across support, education, entertainment, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won’t cover chatbot prompting or dialogue logic here—that comes in the next module. The goal of this section is to understand how speech data flows through a pipeline: from raw audio input to synthesized voice output.\n",
    "The focus here is on building towards a real-time, interactive digital human application, such as a customer support avatar, gaming use case, etc. but we will focus on voice and speech pipeline technical components.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ This notebook is intentionally light on theory. The priority is to help you implement, compare, and modify working components in a modular AI agent stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## By the end of this module, students should be able to:\n",
    "- Describe the full stack of a speech to speech pipeline and its role in a digital human.  z\n",
    "- Compare and choose appropriate technologies for ASR and TTS.\n",
    "- Design for real-time constraints like streaming vs. batch, and low latency interaction.\n",
    "- Understand how data flows between components and what format conversions are required.\n",
    "- Maybe we lightly mention deployment considerations, including hardware, containerization, and service orchestration.\n",

    "**Automatic Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text.  \n",
    "**LLM/NLU**: Understand input and generate a meaningful response.  \n",
    "**Text to Speech**: Converts the LLM response into speech.  \n",
    "**Voice Activity Detection**: Detects when a user is speaking. (Optional) \n",

    "Implementing effective end-to-end (e2e) conversational systems is a major challenge.  \n",
    "Applications like voice assistants are nondeterministic in nature and the above multi-component architecture introduces problems like latency, "

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "A real-time voice agent for digital humans requires careful coordination of VAD, ASR, LLM, and TTS. Each step must be optimized for latency, accuracy, and compatibility. In this module, we introduced the essential technical building blocks. In the next, we’ll apply them to interactive prompting and memory-enabled agents."
