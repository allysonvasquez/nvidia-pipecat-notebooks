# Digital Human Teaching Kit

Welcome to the Digital Humans Course!

In this course, you'll explore how to map out the end-to-end architecture behind AI-driven digital humans. You'll build a high-level understanding of the pipeline's core layers—voice I/O, cognitive engine, and animation—and how they work together to enable real-time, interactive experiences. These foundational notebooks will set the stage for implementation of your own Digital Human Agent.

> **Note:** This course assumes familiarity with Python, foundational AI concepts, and introductory software engineering. Upcoming notebooks will build off of and use the Pipecat framework for hands-on exercises.

## What You'll Learn
A high-level explanation of the learning journey:
- How to build end-to-end digital human pipelines
- Use of the NVIDIA ACE Controller and Pipecat
- Integration of STT, TTS, LLMs, Guardrails, RAG, and animation
- Deployment-ready agents with speech and memory

## Who This Is For
Targeted at grad-level students and developers exploring agentic pipelines and e2e interactive avatars.

## Learning Flow
Recommended progression:
1. Complete setup (Module 0)
2. Follow notebook modules in order
3. Work through activities and optional extensions
4. Complete the capstone and share your results!

## Get Started
Setup your development environment using the instructions at [`0-setup/README.md`](notebooks/0-Setup/README.md) for clarity.
