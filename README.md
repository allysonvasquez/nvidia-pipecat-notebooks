# Digital Human Teaching Kit

## What You'll Learn
A high-level explanation of the learning journey:
- How to build end-to-end digital human pipelines
- Use of the NVIDIA ACE Controller and Pipecat
- Integration of STT, TTS, LLMs, Guardrails, RAG, and animation
- Deployment-ready agents with speech and memory

## Who This Is For
Targeted at master's-level students and developers exploring agent pipelines and interactive avatars.

## ðŸ§­ Learning Flow
Recommended progression:
1. Complete setup (Module 0)
2. Follow notebook modules in order
3. Work through activities and optional extensions
4. Complete the capstone and share your results

## ðŸ”§ Setting Up Your Environment
Installation has been moved to [`0-setup/README.md`](./0-setup/README.md) for clarity.
